I thought I could introduce the topic of team science and collaboration in terms of metaphors with Star Wars.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is Luke Skywalker after he crashed his plane in the swamp on Dagobah.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He cannot solve the the challenge in front of him with the skillsets he has, 

and it is super demoralizing. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And if you imagine him attempting to use whatever pulleys and ropes he might have with him, 

you know it wouldn’t be pretty, 

it wouldn’t be reproducible, 

and it probably wouldn’t get him where he needs to be on time. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But luckily what happens next is that he meets Yoda —

And Yoda has a skillset to solve Luke’s problem in a way Luke never imagined was possible.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He uses the Force.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And this is going to change Luke’s life -- both in terms of skills and mindset. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Luke can see what’s possible and he can learn these skills from Yoda. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And he will be able to not only solve his current challenge, 

but it will broaden his whole mind to what is possible in the future and the scale of the challenges he will take on.

But Luke didn’t go on to defeat the Empire himself -- he had a whole community.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And this community is powerful **because** of the diversity of backgrounds and expertise,
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and although not everyone is a Jedi, 

everyone contributes in really critical ways.

Team Science is the Force that enables us as scientists to do better science in less time. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It empowers us and broadens the scope of scientific challenges that we can tackle.

## What is Team Science?

A collaborative effort to address a scientific challenge that leverages the strengths and expertise of professionals trained in different fields

&lt;br/&gt;
## Why Team Science?

- Promotes breadth of knowledge  

- Applies new methods to old problems  

- Often needed to solve complex problems  

- Teams who share leadership but come from different mindsets are best able to unlock and access innovation.

Next, we will look at what factors you can consider in order to maximize your team's productivity and effectiveness. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

While much of this may seem like -- and can be -- obvious stuff, nothing is as simple as it should be when the human ego is involved.

- self- (and other- ) awareness

- ability to build trust 

- communicates effectively  

- gives and receives constuctive &lt;br&gt;feedback

- embraces a collaborative spirit  
  
- supports and empowers team &lt;br&gt;members

Effective team members and team leaders possess skills that contribute positively to the overall functioning and success of the team. 

&lt;br&gt;
The strength of collaboration skills often depends on an individual’s level of personal insight and self-awareness, ability to be in touch with his or her thoughts and feelings, level of consciousness of his or her impact on other people, and strengths and weaknesses.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Effective team members must be able to contribute to building trust, communicating effectively, and both giving and receiving constructive feedback. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In addition, they must embrace a collaborative spirit, meaning they are willing to share data, credit, and decision–making with other team members.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the collaborative setting, there is a requirement for the leaders to share decision-making, power, knowledge, resources, and credit.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a team leader, you must be able to clearly and decisively communicate, share information, and articulate the team’s shared vision.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You must also support and empower team members, assign roles and delegate responsibilities, and manage team members’ expectations.

## The importance of &lt;br&gt;self-awareness

- strengthens collaboration skills

- provides greater control over emotional reactions to others

- improves the quality of interactions

- helps build other-awareness.

As I mentioned on the last slide, the strength of collaboration skills often depends on an individual’s level of personal insight and self-awareness, ability to be in touch with his or her thoughts and feelings, level of consciousness of his or her impact on other people, and strengths and weaknesses.

self-awareness allows you to exercise behavioral options and choose the behavior that will be most effective, rather than the one that may make you feel good for the moment, but that you will later regret.

As a team leader or member, be aware of your emotional reactions and try to manage them the best you can. 

Emotional reactions can have strong and direct negative impact on the rest of the team.

## The Importance of trust

Trust provides the foundation for a team. 

- not always personal - there are many different types of trust

&lt;br/&gt;

Tips for building trust:

- building and maintaining trust takes work 

- collaborators should be explicit about what they expect from each other

- keep in mind that trust is fragile - if someone’s trustworthiness becomes an issue it should probably addressed promptly.


???
Trust provides the foundation for a team and without it, it is nearly impossible to sustain a collaboration. 

Trust affects how one assesses the future behavior or another person and how one interprets their past and present actions.

While we often think of trust as deeply personal, that is not always the case as there are many different types of trust.
(**"calculus-based" trust**, **"identification-based" trust**, **"competence-based" trust**, **"swift" trust**)

Tips for building trust:

- Keep in mind that building and maintaining trust takes work 

- collaborators should be explicit about what they expect from each other

- keep in mind that trust is fragile - If someone’s trustworthiness becomes an issue it should probably addressed promptly.

&lt;br&gt;
Types of trust:

- **"calculus-based" trust**: built on calculations of the relative rewards for trusting or losses for not trusting

- **"identification-based" trust**: built on an assumption of perceived compatibility of values, common goals, emotional/intellectual connection

- **"competence-based" trust**: built on the confidence in people’s skills and abilities, allowing them to make decisions and train others

- **"swift" trust**: built on giving all team members the benefit of the doubt that their intentions are good with clear goals and limited time.

## The Importance of &lt;br&gt;Effective communication

Communication skills keep the group &lt;br&gt;interacting, cohesive, and on course.


&lt;br/&gt;

Tips for Effective Communication


- Meet regularly

- Help translate 

- Disagree with the idea, not the &lt;br&gt;person.

- Support idea generation and &lt;br&gt;creativity

- Ensure everyone has a voice


.footnote[

???

Different scientific disciplines have their own vocabularies, jargon, and phrasing -- Communication skills are critical and required to keep the group interacting, cohesive, and on course.

Effective comunication depends on a safe environment where team members can openly share and discuss new scientific ideas and take research into new, previously unconsidered directions as well as ensure that difficult conversations can take place.

**Tips for Effective Communication**

- Hold regular meetings to discuss data and results - may need to realign goals and objectives to meet the most recent data and results.
- 
To enhance communications,  it may be beneficial to establish ground rules for how people are expected to communicate with each other during meetings and develop an expectation that data and results will be shared with all team members as well as procedures for doing so.

Respectfully address and resolve debates over science or scientific results through literature reviews, experimentation, outside expert opinion, and other relevant methods.

Help people translate when there are differences in concepts, methodologies, and frameworks.

- When disagreeing, be sure to disagree with the idea, not the person.

You should support idea generation and creativity and it is very important for you as a leader to ensure everyone has a voice. 

Ensuring they feel safe receiving and giving feedback is essential.

The single most important factor in encouraging candid feedback is establishing an atmosphere in which disagreement and constructive criticism are welcomed.

If your response to another team member’s expression of differences is defensiveness, rebuttal, ridicule, punishment, or exclusion—whether in private or public—team members will be unlikely to speak up, even when asked.


However, if you meet team members’ efforts to voice disagreement with both receptivity and appreciation, you will begin to build a base from which others can voice their opinions—both positive and negative—to improve overall team function.

## The importance of collaboration 

.pull-left[
Embrace a collaborative spirit:
- data, credit, and decision–making is shared with other team members
  
- individual contributions are recognized and rewarded in the context of a collaboration

- all who contribute to writing or provide intellectual input are appropriately attributed

???
Of all the aspects of team science, sharing recognition and credit is among the most difficult to master - again, the human ego is quite a beast.

For decades, scientists have largely been recognized—and thus rewarded—for their individual accomplishments. However,
support is increasing for the idea that individual contributions can be recognized and rewarded in the context of a collaboration. Recognition and reward of all team members should be done thoughtfully and fairly.

As a leader, you must be willing to share data, credit, and decision–making with other team members.

It is essential to appropriately attribute all people who contribute to writing or provide intellectual input.

## Conflict is normal

- Disagreement can expand thinking, add new knowledge to a complex scientific problem, and stimulate new directions for research. 

- If it is not handled skillfully, conflict impedes effective team functioning and stifles scientific advancement.


.footnote[

???
Conflict is both an inevitable and a necessary aspect of human interaction

But conflict does not automatically mean there is something wrong with a team. In fact, social cohesion emerges from engaging in and resolving conflicts. 

- disagreement can expand thinking, add new knowledge to a complex scientific problem, and stimulate new directions for research;

however, if it is not handled skillfully, conflict impedes effective team functioning and stifles scientific advancement.


Many scientists are both competitive and conflict avoidant—a potentially counterproductive combination especially for members of a scientific team. Ignoring conflict is a sure way to guarantee that it will remain alive and perhaps worsen.

One arena in which it is especially useful to be aware of your emotions and reactions is in the way you handle and respond to disagreements or other types of conflict.

## Conflict resolution


Questions to explore when facing conflict:

- Who is involved? 

- What are their personalities, emotions, thoughts, motivations, values, ideologies, and/or identities?

- What are the interpersonal dynamics, including communication, rivalry, competition, power, and hierarchy?

- How are the organizational structure and dynamics contributing?

&lt;br/&gt;
Tips for managing conflicts:

- Understand the context of conflict - actively listen &amp; acknowledge emotions

- Look beneath the surface for hidden meaning

- Solve problems creatively and negotiate collaboratively

Questions to explore when facing conflict:

- Who is involved? 

- What are their personalities, emotions, thoughts, motivations, values, ideologies, and/or identities?

- What are the interpersonal dynamics, including communication, rivalry, competition, power, and hierarchy?


Tips for managing conflicts:

- How are the organizational structure and dynamics contributing?

- **Understand the conflict**: resolving conflict requires individuals to take the time to understand what is driving it.

- **Actively listen**: team leaders must develop strong listening skills to thoughtfully and fairly intervene in conflicts 

- **Acknowledge emotions**: they will likely be part of the conflict, but expressing them and hearing them can help lift barriers to resolution.

- **Look beneath the surface for hidden meaning**: hidden fears, needs, histories, or goals may be the underlying source of the problem.

- **Learn from difficult behaviors**: let those experiences help you develop your skills in managing difficult situations and having empathy for and patience with others.


- **Solve problems creatively and negotiate collaboratively**: this also means committing to action.

- **Understand why others might be resistant to change**: the problem could be an unmet need.

As a team leader:

- clearly and decisively communicate and articulate the team’s shared vision

- clearly state research goals

- manage team members’ expectations

- regularly review and revise the team’s vision

???
As a team leader, you must be able to clearly and decisively communicate, share information, and articulate the team’s shared vision.

You must also support and empower team members, assign roles and delegate responsibilities, and manage team members’ expectations.

- Whether you are leading or participating on a research team, you must be able to articulate and commit to the team’s overall goals.

- Each team member’s individual research goals should be clearly stated and their importance should be recognized in the context of the team’s effort.

- A team’s vision is dynamic and will change over time; regularly review and revise (as needed) the team’s vision statement and that of each team member.

## Embrace diversity

???
Team science is an exercise in diversity. 

Although the rationale for team science is grounded in an appreciation of the potential benefits of disciplinary diversity, that diversity does not automatically blend into a harmonious, cooperative team of researchers exchanging information and moving in the same problem-solving direction.

Unless well-managed, any type of diversity can become the basis for conflict and stereotyping or other problems in social integration and communication.

Pay attention to the dynamics of interaction within a team and between diverse groups and be open to surfacing differences so they can be discussed openly.
