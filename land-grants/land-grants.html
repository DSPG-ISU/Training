## Iowa State

ISU is the birthplace of Cooperative Extension in America and has been a leader and innovator in translational science for over 150 years. 

Since 1858, when ISU opened as the first coeducational land-grant school in the country, the university has been committed to sharing research and knowledge with all Iowans.

This project continues the ISU tradition of supporting local communities with translational science.

# Brief History of &lt;br&gt;Land-Grant Universities


---
## The beginning

- In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act, which distributed public domain lands to raise funds for fledgling colleges across the nation. 

- operates to teach all people, even those of average means

The law gave states that remained in the union public lands to be sold or used for profit to establish at least one college that would teach agriculture, mechanical arts (engineering), and military tactics, in addition to traditional classical subjects, to all people, including those of average means. 

Later iterations of the Morrill Act extended the program to the former secessionist states and to a number of Native American tribal groups. 

Over time, most of the land-grant colleges transformed into full-fledged universities charged with teaching, research, and transferring knowledge beyond their campuses.

## The other side of the story
  
- Land-grant universities are also sometimes referred to as land-grab universities

- The Morrill Act is seen as a massive wealth transfer

- Land expropriated from tribal nations was turned into seed money for higher education

## Cooperative Extension System (CES)

Congress passed the Smith-Lever Act in 1914 establishing the U.S.D.A. Cooperative Extension Service

The National CES infrastructure is comprised of more than 100 land grant institutions

The department invested heavily in providing timely data to farmers, so that they could make more rational planting decisions.


Focused primarily on translating and disseminating to the public the evidence-based research findings produced by land-grant universities (or other public universities) and
their agricultural experiment stations to address issues in agriculture and natural resources, human sciences, and community and economic development.

---
## Regional Rural Development Centers (RRDCs)

- created by the Rural Development Act of 1972  

- 4 across the country

---
## CLD3

- CLD3 uses CES as a key distribution channel for infusing data science into local communities to advance economic mobility.
